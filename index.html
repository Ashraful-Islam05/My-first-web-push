      When the weather turns warm, you may spend a lot of time outside. As the sun shines brightly overhead, you may play outdoor sports, go to the beach, or just sit outside enjoying the nice weather. Unfortunately, the more time you spend out in the sun, the more likely you are to get a sunburn. Luckily, there are many ways to treat a sunburn using everyday things you can find in your own home.

         Anyone who has ever had a sunburn knows that they are painful. However, they can also cause more serious problems, such as fever, blisters (‡dv¯‹v), or even skin cancer. Because sunburns can be dangerous, it is best to avoid getting one in the first place. You should not spend too much time outside between the hours of 10 A.M. and 4 P.M., since this is when the sun’s rays are strongest. You should keep your skin covered by wearing a hat, long pants, and a long-sleeved (nvZIqvjv) shirt. You should also be sure to use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.
